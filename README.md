# Python Web Scraping to find out if golf course tee times are available
- Designed to get available tee times from my two favorite golf course websites (Bellevue and Willow Golf Corse).
- The reason I created this app is that I thought it was kind of a hassle to go to every single website, put in the date and time, and check to see if there is availability(Yes, I am lazy).
- This allows you to pick dates up to 2 weeks in advance, which is the reservation limit and saves you the hassle of searching two websites simultaneously for tee time reservations. 

SAVE SOME TIME!!
